### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import re
import pywhatkit as kit
from datetime import datetime
```
Here, you import the necessary libraries: `re` for regular expressions, `pywhatkit` for sending WhatsApp messages, and `datetime` for working with dates and times.

### Step 2: Sample Input
```python
input_text = ["xxxxxx3839"]
```
You initialize a list `input_text` with a sample phone number. Later, you'll read additional phone numbers from a file.

### Step 3: Regular Expression for Phone Numbers
```python
phone_number_pattern = r'\d{3}\d{3}\d{4}'
```
You define a regular expression pattern (`phone_number_pattern`) to match phone numbers of the form "xxx-xxx-xxxx."

### Step 4: Read Phone Numbers from a File
```python
file_path = 'number.txt'
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    # ...
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```
You attempt to read phone numbers from a file named `number.txt`. If successful, the phone numbers are stored in the `text` variable.

### Step 5: Extract Phone Numbers from Text
```python
phone_numbers = re.findall(phone_number_pattern, text)
```
You use the regular expression pattern to find all matching phone numbers in the `text` variable.

### Step 6: Add Extracted Phone Numbers to Input List
```python
if phone_numbers:
    for number in phone_numbers:
        input_text.append(number)
else:
    print("No phone numbers found in the file.")
```
If phone numbers are found, they are added to the `input_text` list.

### Step 7: Message Content
```python
message_content = "..."  # (A long string containing the message content)
```
You define the content of the message you want to send.

### Step 8: Sending Messages
```python
for phone_number in phone_numbers:
    current_time = datetime.now()
    image_path = "Revil.png"
    kit.sendwhatmsg(f"+91{phone_number}", message_content, current_time.hour, current_time.minute + 1)
    kit.sendwhats_image(f"+91{phone_number}", image_path)
    print(f"Message sent to {phone_number} instantly.")
```
For each phone number, you format it, get the current time, and use `pywhatkit` to send a WhatsApp message (`kit.sendwhatmsg`) with the specified content and an image (`kit.sendwhats_image`). The script then prints a confirmation message for each sent message.

Note: The code assumes that the `number.txt` file exists and contains phone numbers in the specified format. Also, make sure to handle exceptions appropriately in a production environment.

Use Case Explanation:
This script is designed for sending event invitations to a list of participants stored in a file. It extracts phone numbers from the file, sends a customized event invitation message along with an image, and provides confirmation messages for each sent invitation. The use case involves efficiently broadcasting details about a cybersecurity symposium event to potential attendees via WhatsApp.
